# Stroke-Risk-Analysis-Excel-Dashboard
Stroke Prediction with EDA, ANOVA &amp; Multiple Regression in Excel | Dashboard &amp; Insights

A data-driven project using Microsoft Excel to explore patterns and predictors of stroke from patient health records. This end-to-end analysis covers data cleaning, descriptive statistics, ANOVA, regression modeling, and interactive visualizations ‚Äî showcasing strong skills in data analytics, healthcare consulting, and public health communication.

## üìå Objective
To identify key risk factors associated with stroke using a cleaned healthcare dataset and generate actionable insights through statistical and visual analysis.

üîß Tools & Techniques
- **Excel (Advanced)**: Pivot tables, formulas, charting, dashboards  
- **Statistical Analysis**: ANOVA, Multiple Linear Regression  
- **Data Visualization**: Clustered columns, histograms, KPI boxes  
- **Public Health Skills**: Risk factor interpretation, Health disparities analysis

## üìä Dataset Summary
- **Rows:** 5,110 patient records  
- **Target Variable:** Stroke occurrence (0 = No, 1 = Yes)  
- **Independent Variables:** Age, BMI, Glucose level, Hypertension, etc.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Only 249 cases had a stroke (~4.87%)*, but the project still reveals meaningful differences and trends across subgroups.

## üîç Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing BMI values and "Unknown" smoking status
   - Created grouped categories (e.g., Age Group, BMI Category)
   - Cleaned all columns, removed duplicates

2. **Descriptive Analytics**
   - Summarized key variables (Age, BMI, Glucose)  
   - Created % stroke rates for categorical subgroups using pivot tables  

3. **Statistical Analysis**
   - **ANOVA**: Stroke patients had significantly higher Glucose (p < 0.0001) and BMI (p < 0.01)
   - **Multiple Regression**: Age, Glucose, BMI, and Hypertension significantly predicted stroke (R¬≤ = 0.072)

4. **Visual Dashboard**
   - Interactive charts for stroke % by age group, glucose level, BMI category, and hypertension  
   - Key KPIs, trends, and summary insights all in one dashboard

## üí° Key Insights
  üîπ **Age**: Seniors (60+) had a stroke rate of 13.15% ‚Äî highest among all groups  
  üîπ **Glucose**: Diabetic individuals had a 10.12% stroke risk  
  üîπ **BMI**: Overweight category showed highest stroke % (6.65%)  
  üîπ **Hypertension**: Stroke rate for hypertensive patients was 13.25% vs 3.97% for non-hypertensive
